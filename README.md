A free, open source, peer-to-peer, UDP-KCP (Mirror) C# based chess game.
Made as a test unity project to learn about high-level networking more than anything lol.

Connect using your friend's IP address. The game uses port 727, so make sure the server has that port open on their router.

Features not implemented (and that I don't plan to implement tbh)
- Castling
- En passant (holy hell)
- Timer
- Server validation
- Game loop
- Matchmaking
